# CREATE A DIAMOND SHAPE WITH CSS

- Let's draw a diamond with HTML and CSS.

- It is really simple.

- You don't need to know Advanced CSS.

- We will use just some border properties.

### STEPS

* Create a div and put 4 spans in it.(This is all the HTML part.)

* Give some width and height to our div to make it a square which can take four four equal squares in it.

* Position of the div will be relative so that we can put our spans(squares) in it.

* Give absolute positionings to our divs. Now we have a div with 4 squares in it.

* Give borders just like I did in my HTML file. 

* Rotate our div 45 deg.

* Make first squares top and left border transparent.

* Our DIAMOND is ready.

* Just make it more beautiful with changing colors.
